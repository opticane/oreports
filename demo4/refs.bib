  abstract = {In order to navigate through the world, people who are blind and visually impaired typically use maps through either textual directions or tactile printouts. However, visual maps on a touchscreen are not accessible to this population. Two prototypes were designed to test users' ability to trace graphical lines and directions through maps on a touchscreen using haptic feedback from an Android smart watch and tablet. With the first prototype, we show that blind and visually impaired users had lower threshold than sighted users for determining the distance between two lines on a touchscreen, suggesting their enhanced ability to form representations of spatial distance from tactile vibrational cues. With the second prototype, we show that it is feasible for blind and visually impaired users to follow directions through graphical maps based on vibrational cues. We believe these results show that our prototypes have the potential to be effective in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {Disability studies and assistive technology are two related fields that have long shared common goals - understanding the experience of disability and identifying and addressing relevant issues. Despite these common goals, there are some important differences in what professionals in these fields consider problems, perhaps related to the lack of connection between the fields. To help bridge this gap, we review some of the key literature in disability studies. We present case studies of two research projects in assistive technology and discuss how the field of disability studies influenced that work, led us to identify new or different problems relevant to the field of assistive technology, and helped us to think in new ways about the research process and its impact on the experiences of individuals who live with disability. We also discuss how the field of disability studies has influenced our teaching and highlight some of the key publications and publication venues from which our community may want to draw more deeply in the future.},
